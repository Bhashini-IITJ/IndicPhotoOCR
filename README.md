# BharatSTR

## Installation
Currently we need to manually create virtual environemnt.
```python
conda create -n bharatocr python=3.9 -y
conda activate bharatocr
cd bharatSTR

pip install pip-tools
make clean-reqs reqs  # Regenerate all the requirements files
# Use specific platform build. Other PyTorch 2.0 options: cu118, cu121, rocm5.7
platform=cpu
# Generate requirements files for specified PyTorch platform
make torch-${platform}
# Install the project and core + train + test dependencies. Subsets: [train,test,bench,tune]
pip install -r requirements/core.${platform}.txt -e .[train,test]
pip install openai-clip==1.0.1

cd ..
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

## Config
Currently this model works for hindi v/s english script identification and thereby hindi and english recognition.

Detection Model: EAST
ScripIndetification Model: Hindi v/s English
Recognition Model: Hindi, English 

## How to use

```python
from bharatOCR.ocr import OCR

# Create an object of OCR
ocr_system = OCR()

# Get detections
detections = ocr_system.detect("demo_images/image_141.jpg")
# Running text detection...
